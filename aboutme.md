title: About me
---

I'm a seasoned museum professional with eight years of experience immersed in the arts. Currently serving as the Database Admin for Collections Information at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, I combine my interests in cultural heritage and data management. My expertise lies in building data workflows, standards, utilizing SQL for data integrity, and crafting analytical reports. I have experience harnessing Python and machine learning for special research in data science. From streamlining processes to implementing long term data preservation and interoperability practices, I'm dedicated to shaping the future of museum data.
