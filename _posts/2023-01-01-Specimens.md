A 2022 LEADING Fellowship & Smithsonian Institution collaboration project. 

Harnessing the capabilities of Named Entity Recorgnition (NER) machine learning tools, this project demonstrates the research output of scholars utilizing Smithsonian museum specimens.

The research of scholars and scientists in the natural sciences depends heavily on the specimens curated and cared for by collecting institutions around the world, such as the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology. 

In this project, we attempt to demonstrate the scholarly impact of natural history specimen collections through citation analysis and bibliometrics.  Of the obstacles we encountered, the most notable was the inconsistent ways in which specimens are cited in literature, which necessitated the use of named entity recognition machine learning tools to find and isolate specimen citations from the research publications. 

In our research output, we illustrate:
- The lack of standards in the community around citing specific specimens and naming collections used as an obstacle to be addressed.  
- The efficacy of a trained named entity recognition machine learning model compared to pattern recognition and other popular AI tools.
- The frequency of specimen citations from a specific collection out of 1,300 publications.
