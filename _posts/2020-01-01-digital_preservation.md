Approaches to Digital Preservation: Re-examining the recovery of the Chora of Metaponto: The Necropoleis Spring 2018 - Spring 2019

**This report is a reflection of a digital archiving project done for the Institute of Classical Archeology at UT, using emulation as a tool to recover legacy file formats for long-term preservation and increased access.** <br>
**A poster on the topic was presented at the Digital Library Federation's Digipres Conference 2018**

In 1998, the Institute of Classical Archeology released a significant work, the Chora of Metaponto: The Necropoleis, spanning two volumes and reflecting more than two decades of archeological research. This report delves into the collaborative efforts of graduate students from Dr. Galloway's Digital Archiving class and the ICA. Together, they leveraged emulation as a powerful tool to recover data from obsolete legacy formats, ensuring long-term preservation and enhanced digital accessibility.

The discussion explores the methodology employed, shedding light on two distinct and occasionally conflicting approaches to digital archiving. One approach emphasizes the preservation of working files within their original context, treating them as evidentiary information. In contrast, the other approach focuses on preserving the intellectual content of the material by transitioning it into new formats. Analyzing the motivations behind these approaches and understanding their respective methods is crucial for archivists. This knowledge aids in clarifying goals and effectively allocating resources for similar projects in the future.
